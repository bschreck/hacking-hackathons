Predicting outcomes of hackathons

This is an unfinished project that attempted to predict the outcome of hackathons as a submission in a hackathon. The best result would have been to successfully predict itself ;).

I worked on this alone and did not nearly finish in time.

The idea was to scrape social media data from people who had competed in previous hackathons (not necessarily at the current one). This data included things like the submissions to these hackathons, but also github profiles, linkedin profiles, personal websites, etc.
